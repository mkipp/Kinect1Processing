# Kinect1Processing

Sketches for **Processing 2** with **Kinect v1**. They require the **SimpleOpenNI** library ([Download page](https://code.google.com/archive/p/simple-openni/downloads)).

These sketches will **not** work with Processing 3 and also - of course - not with the Kinect v2.

I developed the sketches for my course [Interaction Engineering](http://interaction.hs-augsburg.de) at Augsburg University of Applied Sciences.
